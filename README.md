# My Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio. I built this to showcase my projects in Data Analytics and Web Development in a clean, single-page layout.

## Tech Stack
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Custom styling)
* JavaScript

## Important Note
**I have currently stopped EmailJS integration due to receiving too many inconvenient emails. The contact form code is there but disabled for now.**

## How to Run
1.  Download the files.
2.  Make sure your images are in the `docs/` folder.
3.  Just open `index.html` in your browser.

Feel free to look around or use the code!
